Hairball
========

## About

Hairball is an HTTP server and web framework designed for creating _realtime web applications_.

It's written entirely in Common Lisp and is inspired by [Tornado](http://tornadoweb.org)

It's _very much_ a work in progress.

## Installation

To test it out:

 - Download the hairball
 - Install `sbcl`
 - cd ~/Downloads/hairball/demos
 - run `sbcl`
 - enter this: `(load "group-chat")`
 - Point your browser to http://localhost:9021 and chat with yourself

I started it as a break after writing [Building the Realtime User Experience](http://bit.ly/realtimebook) and as a project to kickstart my learning of lisp.
